    <h1>Double Pendulum Calculation</h1>
    <p>
        The double pendulum is a classical system known for its chaotic
        dynamics. Two mathematical tools allow us to model and simulate its
        motion:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lagrangian Mechanics</strong> - a reformulation of classical mechanics based on energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4) Integration</strong> - a numerical method to solve differential equations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lagrangian Mechanics</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Lagrangian mechanics</strong> was developed in the 18th century
        by Joseph-Louis Lagrange. Rather than focusing on forces (as in Newton's
        laws), it concentrates on energy. The central quantity is the
        <em>Lagrangian</em>, \( L \), defined
    </p>
    <p>
        \[
            L = T - V,
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        where \( T \) is the kinetic energy and \( V \) is the potential energy of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
        The path taken by the system between two points in time is such that the
        <em>action</em> \( S \) is stationary (typically a minimum):

        \[
            S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L\, dt.
        \]
        Requiring that small variations in the path do not change \( S \) leads to the Euler-Lagrange equations:
        \[
            \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}\right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} = 0,
        \]

        where \( q_i \) are the generalized coordinates (for a double pendulum,
        these are the angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \)), and \(
        \dot{q}_i \) their time derivatives.
    </p>
    <p>
        This approach captures the dynamics of the system and leads to the
        derivation of the coupled differential equations that describe the
        motion of each pendulum.
    </p>

    <h2>Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4) Integration</h2>
    <p>
        The differential equations obtained via the Lagrangian method for a
        double pendulum are nonlinear and generally lack closed-form
        solutions. To simulate the system, we use numerical integration.
        One of the most popular methods is the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4)
        integration.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given a state vector \( \mathbf{y}(t) \) and its time derivative \(
        f(\mathbf{y}(t)) \), RK4 approximates the state after a small time step
        \( \Delta t \) by computing intermediate slopes:

        \[
        \begin{aligned}
            k_1 &= f(\mathbf{y}(t)), \\\
            k_2 &= f\Big(\mathbf{y}(t) + \frac{\Delta t}{2} \, k_1\Big), \\\
            k_3 &= f\Big(\mathbf{y}(t) + \frac{\Delta t}{2} \, k_2\Big), \\\
            k_4 &= f\Big(\mathbf{y}(t) + \Delta t \; k_3\Big).
        \end{aligned}
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        The new state is then given by:
        \[
            \mathbf{y}(t + \Delta t) = \mathbf{y}(t) + \frac{\Delta t}{6} \left( k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4 \right).
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        RK4 is widely used because it strikes an excellent balance between
        computational efficiency and accuracy, particularly in systems with
        sensitive dynamics like the double pendulum.
    </p>

    <h2>Theory to Simulation</h2>
    <p>
        In a simulation, the state of the double pendulum is represented by:
        \[
            \mathbf{y} = \begin{bmatrix} \theta_1 \\\ \theta_2 \\\ \omega_1 \\\ \omega_2 \end{bmatrix},
        \]

        where \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) are the angles and \( \omega_1,
        \omega_2 \) their angular velocities. The time evolution of this state
        is computed using the RK4 method.
    </p>
    <p>
        Damping (to simulate energy loss due to friction or air resistance) is
        included. This is implemented by multiplying the angular velocities by a
        damping factor after each integration step.
